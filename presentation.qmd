## What is preferential data?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
[![A sample HoR ballot, courtesy of the AEC](./hor-paper.jpg){fig-alt="A sample ballot for ranking Australian house of representatives candidates." width="80%"}](https://www.aec.gov.au/voting/how_to_vote/voting_hor.htm)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
-   One entry = a *ranking* among a common set of *items*.

-   e.g., ballots for the house of reps!

-   "computational social choice, recommender systems, data mining, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, to name just a few" --- [PrefLib](https://preflib.github.io/PrefLib-Jekyll/)

-   Other kinds of preferences can be incomplete or even include ties

## What does tabular preferential data look like?

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
long <- tribble(
  ~ID, ~VoterLocation, ~Candidate, ~Rank,

## The history of `prefio`

::::: columns
:::{.column width="60%"}
-   I wanted to make NSW elections accessible
-   Integrating with the [PrefLib](https://preflib.github.io/PrefLib-Jekyll/) database
-   "stole" Heather's code from `PlackettLuce` for loading PrefLib data and handling preferences
-   Adapted it to mesh nicely with the tidyverse ecosystem

## A "quick" demo

Let's take a quick look at the [2023 New South Wales legislative assembly election](https://pastvtr.elections.nsw.gov.au/sg2301/la/results).

. . .

```{r echo=TRUE}
list.files("nswla_data/")
```

## A "quick" demo

```{r echo=TRUE}
nsw_election_files <- list.files("nswla_data/", pattern = "\\.zip$", full.names = TRUE)

# Load the entire election with readr + dplyr
election <- lapply(
  nsw_election_files,
  function(x) {
    read_delim(x, delim = "\t", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
      select(District, BPNumber, CandidateName, PrefCounted)
  }
) |>
  bind_rows() |>
  print(n = 4)
```

## A "quick" demo

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Format the preferences with prefio
election <- election |>
    long_preferences(vote,
                     id_cols = c(District, BPNumber),
                     item_col = CandidateName,
                     rank_col = PrefCounted) |>
    print(n = 5)
```


## A "quick" demo

```{r echo=TRUE}
election |>
  group_by(vote) |>
  summarise(frequency = n()) |>
  sample_n(5) |>
  knitr::kable(
    format = "html",
    table.attr = 'style="font-size: 0.6em; width: 80%;"'
  )
```

## A "quick" demo

Compare IRV results with [the official results](https://pastvtr.elections.nsw.gov.au/SG2301/LA/state/elected), and much faster than I would have previously thought possible.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Format the preferences with prefio
election |>
    summarise(
        Winner = pref_irv(vote)$winner,
        .by = District
    )
```

## Where to next?

-   I'd like to integrate this back into `PlackettLuce`, where it was born.

-   There are likely many features needed to make this useful to people other than me.

-   If you work with preferential data, give it a go and let me know of any features which may be useful to add!

# The results
